# gameboy-airplane

Just having some fun with gameboy programming! This is a purely a personal project for learning purposes.

## How to

Requires [rgbds](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds) to build and I use [bgb](http://bgb.bircd.org/) to emulate. You will need to tweak the makefile to point to your bgb if you're using it.

To build and run in bgb: run `make`. To just build: `make build`. Outputs rom as `airplane.gb`
